# SU_Sign-lang-detect
# SignLanguageDetectionUsingCNN
This project is designed to recognize and classify hand gestures used in sign language in real time using TensorFlow and OpenCV. 
The system captures frames from a webcam, processes them using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and predicts the corresponding sign.
